When you follow so many tech and legal "influencers", you can promptly notice that only a handful of them can properly do both. I believe that, as me, there are other lawyer-developers out there (or at least some enthusiasts in this niche) that like the idea of having a safe ground to discuss technology applied to the legal field in a way that is between (i) the superficial approach - a "beginners" one used by those who are self-entitled tech lawyers / innovation lawyers - and (ii) a more "technical" or "heavy" approach used by "pure" developers.

I strive to build solutions thought to and by lawyers, which can potentially impact the way we work. And have fun while doing it.
